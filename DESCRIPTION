Description: Calculate and visualize spatial accessibility to facilities using 
    travel time analysis. The package performs cost-distance calculations from 
    facility points to population centers and creates comprehensive maps showing 
    travel time categories. Includes default data for Kenya (population raster, 
    transition matrix, and administrative boundaries) but can be used with 
    custom data for any geographic region.
